        <h1 id="top-of-page">Project of the Year Awards: BBC Worldwide</h1>
            <h2 id="intro">Broadband is child's play for the BBC</h2>
                <p>BBC Worldwide has developed broadband products based on its Tweenies and Teletubbies children's television shows.</p>
                <p>The programmes lend themselves to the project because they split naturally into self-contained segments that can be used as the basis for broadband functionality, such as synchronised karaoke-style text and interactive games and quizzes.</p>
                <p>Both products use about six hours of video: Teletubbies has 52 individual video segments and Tweenies has 100. The products are licensed to broadband service providers AOL and OneTel.</p>
                <p>'Doing these kinds of products should be a huge driver for broadband roll out,' said BBC Worldwide director of commercial broadband Jonathan Crane.</p>
            <h2 id="objectives">What were the objectives of the project?</h2>
                <p>'The objective was to generate revenue based around broadband as a new channel to market,' said Crane.</p>
                <p>'We also wanted to create a product that works for the target market and enables kids to access their favourite TV shows whenever they want,' he said.</p>
                <p>The project relied on editorial input from the programmes' production teams and technical expertise from the BBC's web operations department.</p>
            <h2 id="milestones">What were the key milestones in the implementation?</h2> 
                <p>The team started building the Tweenies product in September 2002 and it was delivered to OneTel in November. The Teletubbies product was started in March this year, and delivered to AOL this month.</p>
                <p>The project's success was built on co-ordinating the different elements of production, says Crane.</p>
                <p>'The products combine TV production skills and resources with web skills. Because they are so video-heavy there was a lot of video editing and post-production work, as well as design elements and the actual HTML coding, so the project management was a challenge,' he said.</p>
            <h2 id="technology">What technology was used?</h2> 
                <p>The products were built using Internet Explorer version 5.0 and the video segments were encoded using Windows Media Player.</p>
            <h2 id="issues">How did you manage the business change and people issues involved?</h2>
                <p>The business change issues around the project are external rather than internal, says Crane.</p>
                <p>'The only way broadband content will work in the market is if business models are changed from narrowband, where content is free and providers hope advertising revenues will cover the cost, to the premium paid-for content model available with broadband. The biggest business change I face is to establish that as a business model,' he said.</p>
                <p>'The most important thing is creating the principle that these things are good enough to pay for.'</p>
            <h2 id="results">What results were achieved?</h2>
                <p>Delivery of the Teletubbies product was delayed by about a month due to imperfect technical co-ordination with the client, but both products were delivered on budget and have had positive feedback.</p>
            <h2 id="lessons">What were the lessons learned?</h2>
                <p>'Throw out everything you know about web sites and remember broadband is what brings entertainment to the internet. To really exploit and show off broadband the product need to be designed around video so keep text to a minimum,' said Crane.</p>
            <h2 id="benefits">What were the business benefits and return on investment?</h2>
                <p>'Broadband is a business we really want to build for the long term and while the BBC is generally cautious about investment, we are prepared to invest in products with a long shelf-life,' said Crane.</p>
                <p>'The return on investment for both products is good and they are there for the long term and will generate a lot more going forward. We have other deals close to being signed both in the UK and internationally and they will both play big part in our broadband roll out.'</p>
            <h2 id="improvements">How do you plan to build on the project further?</h2>
                <p>The next steps in the children’s TV genre will be to do more deals and build more products, says Crane. The team is looking at other brands that would be suitable, such as Fimbles.</p>
                <p>There are also plans for broadband content based around other genres including music, lifestyle, cooking, gardening, comedy and natural history.</p>
                <p>A 'Life of Mammals' product, based around seven hours of video from the David Attenborough series, is due for launch in the autumn. And there are plans for content based around the Blue Planet series and EastEnders, says Crane.</p>
